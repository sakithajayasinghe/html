Create a simple calculator program in Python. The calculator should resolve simple arithmetic expressions by the user entering:
•	An integer (e.g., 6)
•	One of the operators `+', `-', `*' or `/' (e.g., *)
•	Another integer (e.g., 4)
o E.g., to give the expression 6*4
•	The program should calculate the value of the expression entered and display the result.
